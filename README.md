## What

Small exercice in Golang with big numbers.

Iterates over a random starting number to check against Collatz conjecture.

Verification is done using stopping time as opposed to final stopping time, assuming a answer below the current number is already tested anyway.

## Usage

```
./collatz 100
```

Takes a random with 100 figures and starts iterating.

Status will be displayed every seconds

## Postive

If any proof that the conjecture is false, the program will keep displaying the steps for the same number until death end of the universe ;)
